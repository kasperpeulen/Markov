\exercise{1.1.3iiia}{Suppose now that $Z_0,Z_1,...$ are independent, identically distributed random variables such that $Z_i=1$ with probability $p$ and $Z_i=0$ with probability $1-p$. Set $S_0=0, S_n=Z_1,...,Z_n$. In each of the following cases determine whether $(X_n)_{n \geq 0}$ is a Markov chain. In the cases where $(X_n)_{n \geq 0}$ is a Markov chain find its state-space and transition matrix, and in the cases where it is not a Markov chain give an example where $P(X_{n+1}=i |X_n=j, X_{n-1} =k)$ is not independent of $k$. First one $X_n=Z_n$.}

\beginproof
The state space is $\{0,1\}$. As we now that $Z_0,Z_1,...$ are independent, it is clear that $Z_n$ doesn't depend on $Z_{n-1}$. It's transition matrix is:

\[\begin{pmatrix}
1-p & p\\ 
1-p & p
\end{pmatrix}\]
Which is clear from the definition.\endproof

\exercise{1.1.3iiib}{Let $X_n=S_n = Z_1 + ... + Z_n$}

\beginproof
The state space is $\{0,1,...\}$.
Note that:
\begin{align*}
P(S_{n+1} = i_{n+1} | S_0 = i_0,...,S_{n} &=i_{n}) &= P(i_n+Z_{n+1}=i_{n+1} | S_0 = i_0,...,S_{n-1}=i_{n-1} )
\end{align*}

But note here that $Z_{n+1}$ is indepdent of $Z_0,...,Z_{n-1}$, so $Z_{n+1}$ is independent of $S_0,...,S_{n-1}$ and we get that:
\begin{align*}
P(i_n+Z_{n+1}=i_{n+1} | S_0 = i_0,...,S_{n-1}=i_{n-1} ) &= P(i_n+Z_{n+1}=i_{n+1})\\
&=  P(S_n+Z_{n+1}=i_{n+1} |S_n = i_n) 
\end{align*}

It is clear that there is $1-p$ chance that you stay where you are at an given moment. And a chance $p$ that you move on to next state. So we get transition matrix $\Bbb N \times \Bbb N$ with $1-p$ on the diagonal, and $p$ on the line above the diagonal and the rest is $0$.
\endproof

\exercise{1.1.3}{$X_n = S_0 + ... + S_n$}

\beginproof
We have $0,1,...$ agian as state space. This is not a Markov chain. For example:

\begin{align*}
P(S_0 + S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = i  | S_0 + S_1 = k, S_0 + S_1 + S_2 = j) &= P(S_3  = i -j | S_0 + S_1 = k) \\
&= P(Z_1+Z_2+Z_3 = i-j | Z_1 = k)
\end{align*}

So, we see that this cleaerly depends on $k$, and therefore we don't have a Markov chain.
\endproof
